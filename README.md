# Agent-Based Programming Assistant

This project implements a multi-agent system for solving programming tasks using the Gemini 2.0 Flash model. The system consists of specialized agents that work together to understand, plan, implement, and test solutions.

## Features

- **Orchestrator Agent**: Coordinates the team of specialized agents
- **Planning Agent**: Creates detailed technical specifications and step-by-step plans
- **Coding Agent**: Implements solutions following best practices
- **Testing Agent**: Verifies implementation quality and identifies issues
- **Evaluator**: Assesses the quality of solutions against requirements
